# Edit levels like it's 1995

NIE Editor's goal is to be a simple 2D level editor that is pleasant to both create with and use in your game engines.

## Features
* Interface inspired by the GameMaker 8.x room editor
* JSON export
* Light and dark modes
* Room-level history and undo/redo functionality
* Tilemap editor
* [External library](https://github.com/retrogamer500/nie-editor-importer) to make importing levels easy in your own engines

## Downloads

See below for .JAR distributions. NIE Editor requires JRE >=17.

* [1.5.0](https://github.com/retrogamer500/nie-editor/releases/download/1.5.0/nie-editor-1.5.0.zip) - NIE Editor is essentially feature-complete. Small enhancements or bug fixes might be made in the future but the editor is in a great shape to use for full games! 1.5.0 contains multiple large changes to how the project folder structure behaves, and allows right clicking to create, delete, or rename folders. Several icons are updated to look better as well.
