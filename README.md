# Edit levels like it's 1995

NIE Editor's goal is to be a simple 2D level editor that is pleasant to both create levels with, as well as import levels into existing game engines.

## Features
* Interface inspired by OG Gamemaker
* JSON export
* Burns your eyes because dark mode wasn't invented until the 2000s
* Room-level history and undo/redo functionality
* TODO: Tilemap features
* TODO: External Java project to make importing levels easy
